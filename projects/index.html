    <h3>Since my first week as a student at the Illinois Institute of Technology, I have taken part in the student organization <a href="https://illinoistechrobotics.org">Illinois Tech Robotics</a>. I first became interested in ITR because I really like building things and applying my knowledge as well as working with others while doing so. Throughout my time at IIT, I have worked on a plethora of projects in association with ITR and would like to highlight some of the best and most exciting.</h3>

    <p>ITR Goliath is a competitive robot designed to compete in the annual Midwest Regional Design Competition held at UIUC. When I first joined ITR, ITR Goliath was an inactive project with little more than a frame and a few small drive motors. I was very interested in leading and continuing the project with several other students who were also interested in starting an almost brand new project. At first it seemed like getting ITR Goliath competition ready would take a substantial amount of time. Furthermore, I quickly realized that while I was very confident in my knowledge of certain areas, such as electrical and software, while quite uncertain in others, namely mechanical. Therefore, I realized that it would take the efforts of a sizable group of individuals with knowledge and interests in a variety of discliplines in order to successfully overcome the engineering challenges present in such a design. Over the course of 4 competitions, some features of Goliath have changed significantly while others have remained realtively untouched, with Goliath performing better each time. Many of these decisions were influenced by new members joining the project and older members graduating as well as mainly by the lessons learned during the last competition. Things that worked well were rarely modified while areas were flaws were discovered were often reworked significantly. In 2014 and 2015, ITR Goliath won the final demolition round of the competition and in 2016 took first place in the competition.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>Each year during the fall, IIT's biomedical engineering society hosts a pumpkin launch competition where teams of students or alumni build machines to throw common pumpkins across the school's baseball field. The performance of the launchers is scored in 3 categories: distance, accuracy and crowd favorite. ITR has historically had some of the biggest and best performing launchers in the competition. In years past, many of ITR's launchers were variations of catapults. However, owing to the shift in ITR from mostly mechanical engineers to primarily computer engineers, we thought with our in depth knowledge and interest in computers and electronics that although it would be a massive engineering project, a computer driven pumpkin launcher could likely outperform the competing mechanical launchers with ease. After discussing the pros and cons of many designs, we settled on the centrifugal design. In a centrifugal launcher, both the rotational speed of the launch arm as well as release point during the rotation can be controlled via software, ideally allowing for excellent accuracy. Furthermore, unlike catapults which must impart all of the energy to the pumpkin within a a matter of a fraction of a second, centrifugal launchers can add very large amounts of energy to the pumpkin slowly by spinning the arm progressively faster through many rotations before releasing. While the first couple revisions of this launcher did not quite perform as expected, they provided valuable insight into the design of <i>Mach 2</i> as well as taking 1st for accuracy the 2nd year. After analysing all of the shortcomings discovered in the early revisions of this launcher and determined to make this not just perform acceptably, but perform far better than any other design made, it was evident that more engineering as well as the contribution form a larger knowledge and interest base was needed. <i>Mach 2</i> was the product of the work of many interdiscliplinary individuals incorporating newly acquired skills in design and simulation, as well as the lessons learned during past design revisions. The redesigned launcher stood 14 feet tall, was powered by a 5 horsepower industrial motor capable to spinning the arm to speeds in excess of 200 RPM, giving a release speed of upwards of 100 MPH. The computerized release system used an industrial optical encoder to track the position of the arm in its rotation to less than 1/2 of a degree and and electrically triggered pneumatic release system to precisely release the over 1000lbs of tension on the pumpkin retaining straps at launch speed. This new design performed very well, with approximately 75% accuracy and winning ITR 1st place for distance and 2nd place for accuracy.</p>
