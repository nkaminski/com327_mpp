        <p>Welcome to the home of the Kaminski computer controlled holiday lighting system, the most technically advanced indoor and outdoor home lighting display in the area! This computer controlled lighting display has been the product of some of the free time that I have over my holiday break as well as my interest in being consistently invlolved in some cool engineering and design project. This system was designed and constructed starting in 2014 using several pieces of both purchased and custom designed hardware as well as several pieces of open source software. Currently, the display consists of approximately 4000 lights indoors and out, all under full computer control.</p>
